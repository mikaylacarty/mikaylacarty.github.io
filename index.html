<h2>About Me</h2>
	<div class="content">
  <p>My name is Mikayla Carty and I am a biology major at the University of South Carolina. I am from Philadelphia originally and came to South Carolina for the sunshine and culture. I miss home, but I love being at UofSC. I have made many friends here and I love my classes. I have gone through many hardships here, but also have had some great times. I am currently a senior and I am about to graduate. I am scared to graduate but also excited.</p>

<h2>My Future career Plans</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>In the future, I want to go into dentistry. I plan on attending dental school one day. This past year, I applied to MUSC. I did not get into MUSC, unfortunately, but that is okay. My back up plan is to attend a year of a masters degree for biology here at UofSC. I hope to one day re-apply to MUSC and try again next year. It has been a very challenging journey to get this far, and I will not give up. I did an internship and job shadowing to prepare for dental school. </p>
